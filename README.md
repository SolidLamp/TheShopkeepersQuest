## Usage and Requirements

- Requires Python 3.10+.
- Requires ncurses (Linux/MacOS/*BSD/*nix), which is likely pre-installed. For Windows, you must install windows-curses from PyPI using PIP (or your favourite Python package tool).
- To run the game, you simply run `TheShopKeepersQuest.py` with your installation of Python (e.g. `python3 TheShopKeepersQuest.py` on Debian and many others; doesn't matter). It's a simple Python script, really.
